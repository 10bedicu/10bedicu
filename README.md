## Project Overview

**10BedICU** is a web portal that supports the deployment and management of 10-bed ICU units across rural areas in India. Initiated during the COVID-19 Delta wave, the project is a critical component of the Open Healthcare Network (formerly CoronaSafe Network). By integrating with the CARE backend (an open-source EMR system), 10BedICU provides real-time data on ICU capacity, hospital registrations, and tele-ICU services to help public and private stakeholders coordinate critical care services.

Learn more about the [Open Healthcare Network](https://ohc.network/) and the [CARE platform](https://care.ohc.network).

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js (React 17):** Server-side rendering and optimized routing for fast, scalable web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for building modern, responsive UI designs.
- **Google Maps Integration:** Uses `google-map-react` to display interactive maps of ICU locations.
- **Backend Integration:** Connects to the CARE backend (Django/DRF) for dynamic data on hospitals, patients, and ICU status.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on Vercel for continuous deployment and fast global delivery.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v14+ and npm installed.

### Local Development

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ohcnetwork/10bedicu.git
   cd 10bedicu
   ```
2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) in your browser. The page will automatically reload on code changes.
4. **Environment Configuration**
   If you need to use external APIs (e.g., Google Maps), create a `.env.local` file in the root and add your environment variables

### Production Deployment

#### Using Vercel

- Connect the repository to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for automatic builds and deployments.
- Set required environment variables in Vercel‚Äôs project settings.
- Push to the main branch to trigger a deployment.

#### Self-Hosting

1. **Build the Application**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
2. **Start the Production Server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The app will be served on port 4000. Ensure your environment variables are set for production.
